TodayTix coding challenge

THE CHALLENGE: 
Write an iOS app to display the fibonacci sequence in a UITableView. Please be aware of the amount of NSOperations done and give the most efficient solution. 

ABOUT: 
This app displays the Fibonacci numbers in a UITableView from Fib(1) = 1 to Fib(500 - this number can be changed). The caluclation of Fibs after 93 are processed on the background due to the different method of computetion when out of bounds for unsigned long long int.
